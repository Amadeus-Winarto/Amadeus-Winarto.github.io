# A Noob's Take On Functional Programming and Lambda Calculus

## Introduction 
The programming module I took (CS1101S) relied heavily on the famous, or infamous, book titled "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programmmes", otherwise known as SICP. While the original SICP uses Lisp, we used javascript in the course and relied on SICP-js, a javascript rendition of the original book. To put it mildly, the module was mind-blowing. It was totally different from the way programming is usually taught. Instead of teaching assignments on Day 1, we were forced to use a subset of javascript where variable assignments cannot be done. It was the beginning of my learning about functional programming. 

## On Functional Programming
I'm surprised that I didn't wonder why functions in programming are called "functions", because that's a misnomer, at least in the mathematical sense. A mathematical function can be thought of as something that "relates" or connects an element from a set to exactly one other element from a possibly different set.

<p>Figure 1: What a function is. The first one is a function because every member of the set in the left is related to exactly one other element in the right set. The second one is not a function, because "5" is related to both "4" and "7", thus breaking the "exactly one" rule.</p>

 For example, the following function in javascript behaves just like a mathematical function: 
~~~js
function factorial(n){
    return n <=1 ? 1 : n * factorial(n - 1);
}
~~~
This is because for every integer we pass into the function, exactly one integer is spat out by the function. If we try factorial(10) for example, we will always get 3628800. It doesn't matter whether we run it at night, in the morning, while we're watching TV, or whatever. The output is exactly one thing. We call such functions in programming as **pure functions**.

Contrast this to how bank accounts operate. A person that has a bank account can withdraw or deposit their money, and every time they withdraw their money, their bank account balance is different. We can reflect this in JavaScript as follows:
~~~js
function make_account(starting_balance){
    const balance = starting_balance;
    function make_withdraw(withdrawal_amount){
        if(withdrawal_amount > balance){
            return "ERROR: Not Enough Balance";
        } else{
            balance = balance - withdrawal_amount;
            return balance; 
        }
    }
    return make_withdraw;
}

const withdraw_fn = make_account(20);
withdraw_fn(10); // Returns 10
withdraw_fn(10); // Returns 0
withdraw_fn(10); // Returns "ERROR: Not Enough Balance"
~~~
Note how withdraw_fn(10) returns 10 the first time, 0 the second time, and "ERROR: Not Enough Balance" the third time. This violates the rules for mathematical functions.

Why is this so? Well the culprit is really due to the assignment operator that we used. When we allow for variable assignments, we are introducing the concept of "now", otherwise known as "state". This state is reflected by the variable *balance*. Since the state can change, thus the output of the function changes.  

I mentioned how we used a subset of JavaScript where assignments are banned. Surely then, that this language is much "weaker" than traditional programming languages like C or Python, as this language is unable to encode states. Think of how you would write the withdrawal function above without using states:

~~~js
function withdraw_fn(balance, withdrawal_amount){
    return withdrawal_amount > balance
        ? "ERROR: Not Enough Balance"
        : balance - withdrawal_amount; 
}
~~~
We no longer have the ability to remember our balance. We are thus forced to outsource this memory work to the user, who has to input his or her own bank account balance. Besides the fact that it burdens the user, in reality this would never be implemented. Imagine giving users the ability to write down how much money the own however they see fit...

So is our intuition true then? Are languages that are incapable of doing assignments really "weaker" compared to those that can? As it turns out, the answer is no. There is a slew of programming languages that does exactly this, and they are called "functional programming languages". The power of functional languages are guaranteed by **lambda calculus**, and in fact functional languages are build using lambda calculus in mind. 

## The Power of Lambda Calculus
Mathematician Alonzo Church introduced a notion that may be able to serve as the foundation of Mathematics. He called this *lambda calculus*. A different notion, called sets, had been shown to be able to serve the same function. While set theory deals with collections of stuff, lambda calculus deals with functions. There are three things that lambda calculus purport to exist:

1. Variable: A placeholder which holds some value
2. (Function) Abstraction: this allows us to define the rule of functions i.e. given some inputs, what should be outputted
3. (Function) Application: this allows us to obtain the output of functions i.e. pass in some inputs and get what the function needs. 

For example, consider a function that adds one to a number. This function, in the syntax of lambda calculus, can be represented as $\lambda x.(x+1)$. This is read as "a function that takes in x and outputs x + 1". A function application is done with brackets, much like in math. For example, to apply the above function, we can write it as $(\lambda x.x + 1)(5)$. This evaluates to $6$, as expected. 

Note that lambda calculus does not purport the existence of numbers. In fact, just by supposing that the three points above exist, we can reconstruct the entirety of the natural numbers. There is also nothing in the rule that from taking in or outputting functions. As such, we can have functions like $\lambda x. \lambda y. x + y$, which reads "a function that takes in x, and outputs (a function that takes in y and outputs x plus y)". In programming this is usually called treating functions as "first-class citizens", just like the data that we deal with. 

With the above, we can now proceed to see how lambda calculus compares to set theory. The following describes the Church encoding, a method by Alonzo Church to encode natural numbers using his lambda calculus: 

1. $0$ is defined to be the function $\lambda f.\lambda x.x$
2. $1$ is defined to be the function $\lambda f.\lambda x.f(x)$
3. $n + 1$ is defined to be the function $\lambda f.\lambda x.f \cdots f(x)$, where f is applied $n + 1$ times. 

Here one might not feel comfortable since the number $n + 1$ is encoded using a function which relies on us knowing how to apply $f$ to $x$ for $n + 1$ number of times, which is the number that we seek to encode in the first place. Alternatively then, we can think of the number $n + 1$ as the output of doing something to the number $n$. Thus, if we have the number $n$, then we can define $n + 1$ to be $(\lambda k. \lambda f. \lambda x. f(k f x))n$.

Ok how exactly should we understand this? We begin with the basic observation that $n + 1 = (n) + 1 = add_one(n)$. Thus $n+1$ is a function that takes in a number $n$ and outputs a number. This is how we get $(\lambda k. \text{PLACEHOLDER1})(n)$. Since the output is a number, thus PLACEHOLDER1 must have the form $\lambda f. \lambda x. \text{PLACEHOLDER2}$. Now what do we put in PLACEHOLDER2? Well we can make the observation that we we are basically adding one more $f$ everytime we add by $1$. Hence, PLACEHOLDER2 should be $f((n(f))(x))$, or to put it more simply, $f(nfx)$. Just like that, we draw a parallel between lambda calculus and set theory, in that both are able to represent the entirety of the natural numbers

Yeah the symbols are probably mindblowing now. The good thing is, unlike set theory which is hard to program, lambda calculus is super easy to write down in code. In JavaScript, we can write the church encoding for $0, 1, 2, 3$ as

~~~js
const zero = f => x => x;
const one = f => x => f(x);
const two = f => x => f(f(x));
const three = (k => f => x => f((k(f))(x)))(two);

console.log(zero(x => x + 1)(0)); // Outputs 0
console.log(one(x => x + 1)(0)); // Outputs 1
console.log(two(x => x + 1)(0)); // Outputs 2
console.log(three(x => x + 1)(0)); // Outputs 3
~~~
It really works! Note that we really only pass in the arrow function and $0$ to zero, one, two, three so that we puny humans can understand what is going on. It is merely used to demonstrate the correctness of Church encodings. Since we are able to encode numbers and addition by one, we are thus able to encode all the basic operations on numbers such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and all of the natural numbers. With a little more mathematical ingenuity, we see that we are actually able to reconstruct the whole real number system with just lambda calculus. 

How about booleans and boolean operators like OR or AND? In programming we don't just use numbers, we also use "true" and "false". Well we can encode these values as follows:

~~~js
const TRUE = x => y => x;
const FALSE = x => y => y;

const OR = a, b => b(b)(a);

console.log(OR(TRUE, TRUE)) === true; // Outputs true
console.log(OR(TRUE, FALSE)) === true; // Outputs true
console.log(OR(FALSE, TRUE)) === true; // Outputs true
console.log(OR(FALSE, FALSE)) === true; // Outputs false
~~~
Again the results are as expected. We are thus able to encode the booleans and operators on the booleans using pure functions. 

## Conclusion
Even after seeing this for the $n$-th time, I still personallly find this extremely cool. It is not obvious at all that pure functions were able to encode everything. We are probably used to the idea that, if we have to begin somewhere in Mathematics, it would be with the counting numbers. That numbers are the basic indivisible building blocks of Mathematics seems to be an obvious thing. But lambda calculus showed that there is another way. In fact there is another way; we can use sets as building blocks instead, as purported by set theory. Alas lambda calculus is much easier to translate into code, espeically when using languages like JavaScript that supports functional programming. Indeed, functional programming languages rely heavily on lambda calculus in its theoretical ability. 

We mentioned that functional programming languages may feel "weaker" than those that allow assignments. This is shown to be false in the the Church-Turing Thesis, written by Alonzo Church and Alan Turing. It states that something is calculable by a system where assignments are allowed if and only if that thing is calculable by lambda calculus. We won't be going into the details, but I feel that by demonstrating how functions can encode the natural numbers it gives a sense of the power behind lambda calculus.
