	<h1>Gosh, Why Must This Page Exist</h1>
	<p>
		Well, I guess I cannot escape this.. Hmm, who am I? I am currently a student-ish waiting for matriculation into a
		university in Singapore (probably NUS). Guess which major I applied to. I have been working with deep learning since
		2018 as part of my research project in school. Since then, I've been more or less hooked on deep learning, especially computer vision.
		However, it's quite easy to get overwhelmed by everything that is going on in the forefront of the scientific field, and deep
		learning is far from being the exception. This is why I decided to note down what I think have learned throughout my journey. This
		includes what I have done absolutely right, what I have done horribly wrong, and everything in between. Those who don't understand history are bound to repeat it after all.
