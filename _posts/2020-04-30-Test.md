# Introduction to Lagrange Multiplier
Optimisation problems are very crucial to address in real life. With a good optimisation algorithm, we can do things like modelling stock markets, creating Artificial Intelligence capable of processing languages, build efficient robots, make better decisions, and more. As such, the search for better optimisation algorithms that runs at high speed and gives high quality solution is an ongoing process. We will be talking about one such algorithm, the method of Lagrange multiplier. It allows us to find the maximum or minimum of a function, subject to certain constraints. For example, suppose we have a function $f:\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
