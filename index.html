	<h2> What is This Site All About? </h2>
	<p align='justify'>This webpage is to keep track of my notes on AI since 2020. They are by no means ordered according to the level of difficulty
	in AI; my very first AI-related project is about object detection, which is why the first few posts are about it. </p>
	<p align='justify'>Not everything in this blog will be notes on research papers. There are some articles about my experience throughout my lifelong journey
	. These articles will probably be about the task at hand, what I tried, why I did what I did, and what I wished I had done. The idea 
		behind documenting these things is two-fold: it serves as a reminder for me while also be a warning for those going down a similar path. </p>
	<p align='justify'> I try to be as beginner-friendly as possible in these posts. At the same time, however, I do not wish them to be too "dumbed down"; 
		I think there are wayyyy too many articles out there that are too easy to be helpful for coders or too hard for people without a background in 
		Linear Algebra and Advanced Calculus. That being said, these mathematical tools will, in my experience, be very useful. As such, 
		there will also be some articles dedicated solely on the Mathematics behind it all. Currently, this page does not have too many posts, 
		so I don't think there is a need to sort the posts other than by date. If one day such sorting becomes necessary, however, I'll be sure
		to update the site's structure again. </p>
	<p> Cheers,</p>
