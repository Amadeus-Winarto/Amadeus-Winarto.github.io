                        <p>Hi! I'm Amadeus! I'm currently a freshman studying Computer Science in the National University of Singapore.</p>
                        <p>My venture into the world of Comp. Science is relatively recent. I started learning about Deep Learning back in Junior College as part of my research project. Reason? Well it sounded cool and I wanted to learn something new. That sent me into this rabbit hole of learning many new, different things ... </p>
                        <p>... which brings me to the purpose of this site. It's basically my Allroom. It's where I try to do some front-end development (Hence done with React, as I'm learning React now). It's where I put my thoughts on the things I learned (knowing me it's probably out-dated). It's also where you can get to know me better. There (should) be a portfolio page, and soon I'll be adding a project page too! Feel free to look around, and excuse me for the mess / broken links :)</p>
                        <p>Cheers,</p>
                        <p>Amadeus</p>
